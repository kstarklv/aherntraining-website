Here in the Ahern Training Department, we have several very dynamic ways to deliver Training to you:
<ul>
<li> Documents
<li> PDFs
<li> Courses
<li> Videos
<li> Live Training
<li> Hands-on Training
</ul>
</p><p>
All of this training is organized and delivered to you through the <strong>RentalMan Learning Management System</strong>.
</p><p>
This program is the main place to go to find Training assigned to you.  You can search for all Training by key words found in the title or by the Learning Activity number (the 5 digit number assigned to every Learning Activity). Be sure to clear the Published and Completed fields if you want to search all Learning Activities assigned to you.
